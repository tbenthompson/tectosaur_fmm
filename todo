-- FMM P2P and standard direct algorithm disagree in value. YIKES!
use FMM for okada
-- just try it out first, make sure its accurate.

setup github repo for tectosaur_fmm.
fix up the fmm tests
read about the implementation of the high-performance volumetric integration tools.
why didn't the fft stuff work in the past?
get the gpu fmm working completely
think about using a uniform octree for its speed advantages.
determine whether the re-use or FFT of m2l kernels would make any sense, take advantage of homogeneity?

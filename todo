uniform octree to speed up fmm setup and standardize some of the translation kernels.

move fmm_integral_op into this package

use FMM for okada -- just try it out first, make sure its accurate.

optimize gpu kernels

read about the implementation of the high-performance volumetric integration tools.

reading exafmm stuff is interesting: https://github.com/exafmm/exafmm-alpha/blob/master/gpu/traversal.h

2D fmm

test laplace single layer and laplace hypersingular

why didn't the fft stuff work for the m2l in the past?

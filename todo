test fmm with elastic kernels more
rename UTAH to elasticUTAH, standardize the inputs for the vector/tensor kernels, refactor that shit!
2D fmm
uniform octree to speed up fmm setup and standardize some of the translation kernels.

use FMM for okada
-- just try it out first, make sure its accurate.

read about the implementation of the high-performance volumetric integration tools.

why didn't the fft stuff work for the m2l in the past?

reading exafmm stuff is interesting: https://github.com/exafmm/exafmm-alpha/blob/master/gpu/traversal.h
